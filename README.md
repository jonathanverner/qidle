# Q-idle #

Q-idle is a Qt version of the shell part of the Idle IDE for Python.
It runs code in a different process and thus allows easier interruption
of the shell (and long running code does not freeze the interface).

## Features ##

  - syntax hilighting
  - code completion & filename completion
  - reload file on change (just open a file or drag and drop it onto the shell window)

## Planned Features ##

  - multiple tabs
  - inspection tools
  - debugger
